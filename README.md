- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer "bug" was actually a real insect?
- In 1947, when Grace Hopper was working on the Harvard Mark II computer, she found a moth causing a malfunction.
-  She removed it and taped it to the logbook with the caption "First actual case of bug being found."
-  This incident led to the term "debugging" in computer science!
